                    Yuva Marathi (Marathi Literary Association) is a Literary and Cultural Club at Vellore Institute of Technology in Tamil Nadu. 
                    Having been established in 2016, we represent the magnificent culture and language of Maharashtra and pride on being a ‘Home away from Home’ 
                    for all Marathi students. In spite of being founded in Tamil Nadu, we have 150+ enthusiastic members functioning in nine departments working 
                    towards the fulfilment of our motto – ‘To promote Marathi culture and provide a platform to the young girls and boys for showcasing their talents and skills.’
